# Nodel Model
A web-based software architecture visualization and simulation studio, based on node functionality.

## Software Architecture Visualization and Simulation Studio

### System Description

A web-based software architecture visualization and simulation studio designed to support software engineers and architects in modeling, integrating, and analyzing complex technical systems. It offers an intuitive node-edge visual workspace, drag-and-drop model selection, interactive descriptions with AI-assistance, and multiple analytical views, enabling precise architectural planning and effective communication. With robust data handling, local caching, and versatile export functionalities, the platform ensures users remain fully in control of their data and simulations.

##$ Technical Requirements Documentation

#### 1. Model Management

Adding Models:
 - Allow users to add models from various software and cloud engineering domains.
 - Provide search functionality and manual selection (palette-based) methods.
 - Enable drag-and-drop functionality to place nodes onto the workspace.

Model Details:
Each model must include:
 - Technology homepage URL.
 - Source code repository link (if available).
 - Relevant public research papers.

Model Customization:
 - Users can rename models.
 - Users can describe models according to specific use cases and project vision.
 - Include AI assistance (triggered via Lightning Bolt icon) to automatically generate model descriptions.

#### 2. Model Integration and Aggregation
 - Integrate and aggregate models effectively to align with user-defined technical architectures and solutions.
 - Enable seamless combination of multiple models for complex system designs using a node-edge visual interface.

#### 3. Architectural Visualization and Analysis
Lens Views:
 - Provide multiple lenses for different analysis perspectives (e.g., cost analysis lens).

Annotations:
 - Support adding group annotations.
 - Support text annotations.
 - Allow collapsing and expanding models to simplify complex views.

Node Presentation:
 - Use visual cards with icons and descriptions to represent nodes clearly.
 - Support editing node details in modal dialogues.

#### 4. Simulation Management

Local Simulation Saving:
 - Simulations run entirely in the web browser.
 - Automatic caching of simulations locally in the browser.

Manual Saving:
 - Users must explicitly save simulations to ensure persistence.

Simulation Metadata:
 - Allow recording of simulation metadata and project-level details.

#### 5. Import/Export Capabilities
Image Export:
 - Export system visualizations as images for integration into documentation, presentations, or printing.

#### 6. User Assistance and Orientation
Interactive Orientation:
 - Include an interactive orientation accessible via an "Information Tab" for studio navigation and feature explanation.

Community Support:
 - Provide direct contact via community support email for user inquiries and feedback.

#### 7. Data Responsibility
 - Ensure complete user control over data, clearly communicating that users are fully responsible for data management and security.
